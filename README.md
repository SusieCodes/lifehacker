## Description

Life Hacker is a React App I built to track my activities, journal entries, grocery list, digital sticky notes, to-do list, service providers, recommendations, and a wishlist. My app centers around a robust contact list that lets me keep track of important information about the people I care about so I'll never forget significant dates and information. Different shades of blue were used throughout the site to instill a feeling of calm, trust, and serenity while using this web-based app.
